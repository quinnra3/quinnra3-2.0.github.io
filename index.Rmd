This is a [link](https://www.google.com/) to a good data science tool. Here's a link to [P8105](https://p8105.com). SOON: a link to another page on this site. Here's a link to the [about](about.html) page. 

All this to say, that everything you can do in Rmd, you can do on your website! (not that you'd want to include a plot...)

Remember, the most important thing is that the things on the website itself are really important. The stuff done in Rmd files is the exact same thing that goes online - so be aware of organization and how it looks to other users.
